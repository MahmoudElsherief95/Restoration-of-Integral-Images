# Restoration-of-Integral-Images


Project Overview

This project focuses on the restoration of integral images using a deep learning approach with a U-Net model. The U-Net architecture is adapted specifically for grayscale integral images, aiming to enhance image quality by reducing noise and improving details.

U-Net Model for Image Restoration

The U-Net architecture is well-regarded for its effectiveness in various image processing tasks. In this project, it is utilized for the restoration of grayscale integral images. The model comprises convolutional layers for feature extraction and up-convolutional layers for image reconstruction, making it ideal for handling the nuances of grayscale integral images. It is designed to learn complex patterns, enabling effective restoration while maintaining image integrity.
